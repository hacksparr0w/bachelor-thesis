\chapter{Conclusion}

This work used the DeepMD methodology to demonstrate the viability and
efficiency of machine learning potentials for performing molecular dynamics
and calculating material properties of both crystalline and amorphous
materials. We've trained wide variety of DNN models to show how the
hyperparameter selection affects the inference accuracy and computational
efficiency. We then used the best performing models to perform molecular
dynamics simulations of crystalline and amorphous silicon. Subsequently, we
used the data from the molecular dynamics simulations to compute various
material properties of silicon. The results from the machine learning models
were very promising and show that we can get quite accurate results with
relative errors $\sim 30 \%$ for the material properties even with very small
training data sets. We note that the accuracy of the results can be improved
drastically by using larger training data sets and that the quality and size
of the training data set is the most important factor limiting the model
prediction accuracy. We also note that this may be quite problematic as
quality training data can only be obtained with computationally expensive
quantum mechanical simulations and thus is the main bottleneck for the DeepMD
methodology.

Future work should focus on improving the quality of the training data sets,
coming up with methodologies to generate training data on the fly (e.g. by
using the active learning approach), comparing the DeepMD methodology with
an alternative machine learning implementations or enhancing the current
DeepMD protocol presented in this work by moving to GPU-accelerated learning
and inference.

We explore the methodology of machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics
simulations for quantum chemistry and solid state physics and demonstrate that
by using the DeePMD method, it is possible to achieve linear scaling with
system size while maintaining computational accuracy comparable to that of ab
initio calculations. To show this, we use DeepMD to calculate various material
properties, such as relaxation energy, relaxation volume, and bulk modulus,
for select atomic structures and equate the precision of our results with
their ab initio counterparts. The implementation of our approach uses the
DeePMD-kit software suite with the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator and
leverages active learning to train deep potential neural networks.

We explore the methodology of machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics
simulations for quantum chemistry and solid-state physics by using the Deep
Potential Molecular Dynamics (DeePMD) method. Several neural network
potentials with different network architectures and different training data
were trained based on density functional theory calculations of crystalline
and amorphous silicon and used to calculate various material properties, such
as temperature-dependent equilibrium energy, equilibrium volume, bulk modulus,
and coefficient of thermal expansion. The results were compared to
\textit{ab initio} and experimental results, and the performance of the DeepMD
potentials was critically evaluated.Â

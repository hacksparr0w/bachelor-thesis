We explore the methodology of machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics
simulations for quantum chemistry and solid state physics and demonstrate that
by using the DeePMD method, it is possible to achieve linear scaling with
system size while maintaining computational accuracy comparable to that of
\textit{ab initio} calculations. To show this, we use the Deep Potential
Molecular Dynamics scheme to calculate various material properties, such as
equilibrium energy, equilibrium volume, and bulk modulus, for select atomic
structures and equate the precision of our results with their
\textit{ab initio} counterparts. The implementation of our approach uses the
DeePMD-kit software suite with the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator and
leverages active learning to train deep potential neural networks.

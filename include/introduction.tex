Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for calculating the
physical movements of atoms and molecules. MD simulations work by numerically
solving Newton's equations to obtain the trajectories of atoms and molecules.
The forces acting on the simulated particles, along with their potential
energies, are calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanical
force fields. MD is an invaluable tool used in many disciplines, including
physics, chemistry, biology, and material science, as it enables running
complex experiments virtually, examining their results on atomary scales,
which might be unreachable even with costly laboratory equipment.

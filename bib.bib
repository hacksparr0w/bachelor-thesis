  abstract = {The law of energy conservation is used to develop an efficient machine learning approach to construct accurate force fields. Using conservation of energy—a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems—we develop an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) approach to construct accurate molecular force fields using a restricted number of samples from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. The GDML implementation is able to reproduce global potential energy surfaces of intermediate-sized molecules with an accuracy of 0.3 kcal mol−1 for energies and 1 kcal mol−1 Å̊−1 for atomic forces using only 1000 conformational geometries for training. We demonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics simulations for molecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations, thereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy and transferability of high-level ab initio methods.}

  abstract = {Eulerian finite strain of an elastically isotropic body is defined using the expansion of squared length and the post-compression state as reference. The key to deriving second-, third- and fourth-order Birch&ndash;Murnaghan equations-of-state (EOSs) is not requiring a differential to describe the dimensions of a body owing to isotropic, uniform, and finite change in length and, therefore, volume. Truncation of higher orders of finite strain to express the Helmholtz free energy is not equal to ignoring higher-order pressure derivatives of the bulk modulus as zero. To better understand the Eulerian scheme, finite strain is defined by taking the pre-compressed state as the reference and EOSs are derived in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian schemes. In the Lagrangian scheme, pressure increases less significantly upon compression than the Eulerian scheme. Different Eulerian strains are defined by expansion of linear and cubed length and the first- and third-power Eulerian EOSs are derived in these schemes. Fitting analysis of pressure-scale-free data using these equations indicates that the Lagrangian scheme is inappropriate to describe P-V-T relations of MgO, whereas three Eulerian EOSs including the Birch&ndash;Murnaghan EOS have equivalent significance.},
